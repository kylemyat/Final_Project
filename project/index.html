    <h1>Loan Prediction Model - Feature Importances</h1>
    <p>
      This page showcases the results of a machine learning model trained to predict loan amounts. The model, a Decision Tree Regressor, was optimized through hyperparameter tuning and trained on a dataset containing information such as loan term, employment length, and home ownership. The accompanying bar chart illustrates the importance of various features in influencing loan amounts. The model achieved a mean squared error of 0.000637880445971776, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing relationships within the data.
