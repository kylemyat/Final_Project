# Final_Project

Define what metrics will be used to evaluate success (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

2. Data Collection
Sources for Data:
Credit Bureaus: Obtain anonymized credit score data from credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.

Public Datasets: Use public datasets like FICO scores or datasets from Kaggle for experimentation.

Data Requirements:
Credit score history, loan repayment history, demographic information, etc

3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect entries.
Transformation: Normalize or standardize numerical data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be relevant for predicting loan eligibility (e.g., debt-to-income ratio).

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms.
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting Machines
Neural Networks

5. Model Training and Validation
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the model on the training set.
Validate the model on the validation set and tune hyperparameters.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Database Tools: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau.



Project Goals:

Input factors: Loan amount, purpose of loan, annual income, and potentially other factors to determine the rate that a person may get for their loan
